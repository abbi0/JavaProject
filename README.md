This project is an ongoing project with the goal of better GUI design. My goal is to be able to convert my programs into a cleaner layout involving GUI. 

As the rest of the semester goes on, I plan on reading into GUI programs more and developing my skills slowly but surely. 

First I am starting with GUI in Java since I personally really enjoy working with Java programs.

As time goes on I will branch out to other programming languages, most likely Python and then C++, in that order. 

Any recommendations and criticism are recommended and very helpful!!!
